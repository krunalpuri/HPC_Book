		\hline
		Abbrevation & Count & Description \\
		\hline
		PP & 26 & Pleasingly Parallel or Map Only \\
		\hline
		MR & 18 & Classic MapReduce MR (add MRStat below for full count) \\
		\hline
		MRStats & 7 & Simple version of MR where key computations are simple reduction as found in
statistical averages such as histograms and averages \\
\hline
MRIter & 23 & Iterative MapReduce or MPI \\
\hline
Graph & 9 & Complex graph data structure needed in analysis \\
\hline
Fusion & 11 & Integrate diverse data to aid discovery/decision making; could involve sophisticated
algorithms or could just be a portal \\
\hline
Streaming & 41 & Some data comes in incrementally and is processed this way \\
\hline
Classify & 30 & Classification: divide data into categories\\
\hline
S/Q & 12 & Index, Search and Query\\
\hline
CF & 4 & Collaborative Filtering for recommender engines \\
\hline
LML & 36 & Local Machine Learning (Independent for each parallel entity) \\
\hline
GML & 26 & Global Machine Learning: Deep Learning, Clustering, LDA, PLSI, MDS, Large
Scale Optimizations as in Variational Bayes, MCMC, Lifted Belief Propagation,
Stochastic Gradient Descent, L-BFGS, Levenberg-Marquardt. Can call EGO or
Exascale Global Optimization with scalable parallel algorithm \\
\hline
 & 51 & Workflow: Universal so no label \\
\hline 
 GIS & 16 & Geotagged data and often displayed in ESRI, Microsoft Virtual Earth, Google
Earth, GeoServer etc. \\
\hline
HPC & 5 & Classic large-scale simulation of cosmos, materials, etc. generating (visualization)
data \\
\hline
Agent & 2 & Simulations of models of data-defined macroscopic entities represented as agents \\

Based on the the tabulated results od the table \ref{table:NIST_vs_ogres}, Qiu et al. \cite{Qiu2014} identified five programming models to be used programs addressed in big data HPC problems. These five programming models are shown in table \ref{table:NIST_5_Programming_model}.
